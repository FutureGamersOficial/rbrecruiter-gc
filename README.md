## The quick and pain-free form management solution for communities

Have you ever gotten tired of managing your Minecraft server/network's applications through Discord (or anything else) and having to scroll through hundreds of new messages just to find that one applicant's username?


Wish you had a better application managemet strategy? Well, then RBRecruiter is for you! It was originally designed and developed for internal use for a gameserver network, but sharing is caring!


# Features (not exhaustive)
 - Beautiful (customizable in future releases) landing page for your application management center; It displays all available staff ranks
 - Contact form on landing page for those un-registerd users
 - User registration/authentication system; Users will be sent to the authentication flow to complete their application, if not logged in
 - Candidate tracking system - Applicants will be tracked from start to finish.
 - Peer approval system - Have all your staff members vote on applications and decide whether they should be accepted (this is overridable)
 - Interview scheduling (simple) - Schedule interviews with your candidates and automatically notify them!
   - Interview notes: Every staff member is able to add and edit interview notes (how the interview went, etc)
 - Application comments: Finally no more having to go to a private Discord channel just to comment on a single application. Comments are organised neatly for every application! This should help in the decision process of voting for an application.
 - User profiles - Fill out your profile for others to better find you
 - User directory - Public profile directory for everyone
 - Staff rank management - Add/remove ranks on demand, that users will be able to apply to
 - Simple form builder - Create your application forms easily!
 - Termination - Has a staff member met their untimely demise? Terminate them. This will strip their permissions and roles.
 - Controllable permissions - Every user has permissions! Control who has access to what (You can skip the application process and add staff members directly here).
 - Ban system - Having trouble with pesky spammers? Ban them! This will publicly shame their profile and keep them from signing up or logging in.
 - Notifications: Notifies slack and email primarily (Slack notifications currently broken)

 And many more features!

 # Stability
 
 Every released version is currently pre-release. The ``main`` branch is currently stable and ready to use, however, we don't recommend updating your app until a new release comes out.
 
 At the moment, each new feature goes into its separate branch so that ``main`` remains stable. When the features being worked on are ready and tested, they are merged onto ``main``, and a new release can be started. The main branch is write-protected.
 
 *Note: This application is NOT production ready! It won't be until the first stable release comes out, which might take a bit longer.
